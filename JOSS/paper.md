# Summary
PyBCI is a python package developed to facilitate the design of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) by providing a platform for real-time EEG data acquisition, online signal processing, and rapid prototyping of adaptive algorithms. PyBCI aims to make BCI design more accessible to researchers and developers without extensive knowledge in signal processing or machine learning​1​.

# Statement of Need
Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are systems that provide a direct communication pathway between the human brain and external devices. These systems are used in various applications ranging from assistive technologies to gaming and virtual reality. Despite the increasing interest in BCI technologies, the development of BCIs requires a deep understanding of multiple disciplines including neuroscience, signal processing, and machine learning. This complexity often limits the accessibility of BCI development to researchers and developers who may not have expertise in all of these areas.

PyBCI was developed to address this challenge by providing a comprehensive platform for BCI design. The package facilitates real-time EEG data acquisition, online signal processing, and the rapid prototyping of adaptive algorithms. It supports multiple EEG devices and signal processing and machine learning algorithms, allowing for customization based on the user’s comfort and preference.

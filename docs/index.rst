Welcome to pybci documentation!
===================================

**PyBCI** is a Python interface to create a BCI with the `Lab Streaming Layer<https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer.`, `scikit-learn<https://scikit-learn.org/stable/#>` and `TensorFlow<https://www.tensorflow.org/install>` packages. Also leveraging packages like `Antropy<https://github.com/raphaelvallat/antropy>`, `SciPy<https://scipy.org/>` and `NumPy <https://numpy.org/>` for time and/or frequency based feature exraction.

By utilising libraries like `antropy <https://github.com/raphaelvallat/antropy/>`, `Sklearn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable//>`, `LSL <https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer>`, and others we are able to stream, record, visualise, process, analyse and classify physiological sensor data.

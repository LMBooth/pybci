# PyBCI
A Python interface to create a BCI with the [Lab Streaming Layer](https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer), [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/#) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install) packages, leveraging packages like [Antropy](https://github.com/raphaelvallat/antropy), [SciPy](https://scipy.org/) and [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) for time and/or frequency based feature extraction.

ToDo!
Implement split epoch window settings to allow one marker to signify long period of data which can be split in to multiple epochs for training.

## Curently in Alpha, come back in a few days for updates!
